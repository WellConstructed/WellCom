  <h1> Why WellCom? </h1>
  <p>319 million people in sub-Saharan Africa lack access to clean drinking
    water. <br><br>

    Handpump wells are a cost-effective way to bring clean water to remote areas.
    However, within the first year, almost half of handpumps break down, and at
    any given time, one third of rural handpumps in sub-Saharan Africa are
    nonfunctional.  <br><br>

    WellCom enables aid organizations to remotely monitor their wells by providing
    automated usage statistics via cellular networks.  This data enables
    organizations to respond quickly when a well breaks, optimize operations, and
    quantify the impact of their work. </p>

  <h1> How it works </h1>

    <p>WellCom's hardware is made using materials that are both easily available
      and cost effective.  The monitoring system is self contained and can
      function for long periods of time without any maintenance.
      <br><br>
      WellCom is an open source project meaning all of our designs are available
      for your viewing and replication.  Necessary materials includes:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Arduino Uno</li>
        <li>FONA gsm module</li>
        <li>3.7v 1200mAh Battery</li>
        <li>5v Solar Panel</li>
        <li>USB/DC/Solar Lithium Ion/Polymer charger kit</li>
      </ul>

    <p>For a more detailed parts list and construction schematic, please visit the
