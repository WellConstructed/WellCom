# WellCom

WellCom enables organizations to remotely monitor their wells.  It helps them respond quickly when a well breaks, optimize operations, and quantify the impact of their work.

This is accomplished using an arduino uno, a small, inexpensive microcontroller, fitted with a FONA 800 GSM module which allows for data transfer via an HTTP request over cellular network.  Data is gathered using a temperature sensor which creates usage statistics as water travels through the pump system.  The unit is also fitted li-ion battery, which is charged using a 5v solar panel and lithium ion/polymer charger allowing constant monitoring over a 24hour period.

WellCom is an open source project, built by volunteers.

## WellCom App
The WellCom App is built with Python and Django.  It is a work in progress and we are looking for volunteers to continue it's development!
